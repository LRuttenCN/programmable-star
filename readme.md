# Some code
This repo contains stand-alone example programs for the programmable christmas star.
Each file can be run without any prerequisits.

Copy it to the pi (e.g. using `scp`) or connect to the pi and directly fetch it from github: `git clone https://github.com/LRuttenCN/programmable-star.git`.
Then run

`sudo python3 <filename>.py`

Different examples have different levels of complexity. Most are adapted from the modmypi repo to be standalone.

Have fun!
